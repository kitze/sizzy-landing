title: Disable Navigation Sync
slug: disable-nav-sync
description: You already know that Sizzy keeps all your devices in sync. But that doesn’t mean you cannot work on multiple pages at the same time. You can disable the navigation sync, and every device will have it’s own navigation stack so you can preview a different page on each device.
