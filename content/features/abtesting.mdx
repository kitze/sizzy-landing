title: A/B Testing
slug: ab-testing
description: We has a nifty way for you to allow A/B testing within Sizzy. When you open your page in Sizzy, you can access the current device’s details from the <code>window.__sizzy</code> object so you can write conditional logic to test in particular devices. </br>Moreover, you can make the debug logic work only in Sizzy so it doesn’t run for your users even if it’s shipped to production.
