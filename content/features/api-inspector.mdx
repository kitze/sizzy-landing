title: API Inspector
description: The API Inspector panel in Sizzy will help you quickly monitor, test, and troubleshoot your APIs, saving time and effort. Test your REST, GraphQL, or form requests and view well-formatted responses. You can even save a list of requests as part of your project, so each project will have its own list of API requests.
