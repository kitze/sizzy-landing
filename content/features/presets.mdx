description: Presets is a very powerful Sizzy feature that allows you to switch between very complex workflow setups with ease. Imagine a preset like a snapshot of your Sizzy workspace that you can go back to any time. <br/>For example, you might want to have a preset for testing all the locales your site uses at once, one for testing light/dark mode, one to test a page for both admins and users, and one to make sure your page looks fine on all phones and tablets.
