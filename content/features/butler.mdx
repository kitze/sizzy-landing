description: If you’re a power user, we know how much clicking around in the UI slows you down. So we have just the thing for you. <br/>Trigger the Butler by pressing a keyboard shortcut or by saying “Batman sucks!” and type away what you want to do. There’s a Butler command for everything Sizzy can do.
