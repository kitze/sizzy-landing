title: CSS Overrides
description: Write custom CSS styles for all devices, plus extra styles for each individual device. This way, you can experiment with CSS and once you find the perfect style you can copy it back to your code editor.  If you're using css-in-js, you can use the “Pick element to override” button to quickly grab the CSS selector.
