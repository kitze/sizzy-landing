title: Styles Inspector
description: The Styles Inspector is a handy way to inspect and modify any element's CSS classes and styles without having to leave Sizzy or dig through DevTools. This is super handy when working with Tailwind CSS or any similar CSS library. All changes are live on the page and you can copy the final list of classes when you are done tweaking.
