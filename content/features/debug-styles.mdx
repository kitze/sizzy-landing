description: No more <code>border&#58; 1px solid red;</code> dance. Sizzy has a bunch of ways for you to debug your styles. You can even visualise elements with z-index, and add custom debugging classes that will only show up in Sizzy so you donâ€™t have to worry about accidentally shipping them to production.
