title: Software Keyboard Simulation
description: A part of making your sites responsive is to make sure all your inputs and forms look good and are accessible when a software keyboard pops up. Sizzy simulates a software keyboard and adjusts your viewport just like it would happen on a physical device, so you can make sure your forms are not annoying to use on mobile devices.
