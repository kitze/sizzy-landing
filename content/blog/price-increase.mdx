title: New pricing
slug: new-pricing
description: After 3 years of non-stop development, we're finally increasing the prices (for new customers only)

TL;DR
- As an existing customer (before August 18th), you'll keep your old pricing forever ü•≥
- New prices are: $15 per month, or $12 per month when paid annually
- With the new pricing, each seat owner can activate Sizzy on 3 devices at the same time
- This means that if you buy a license with 1 seat for yourself, you can activate Sizzy on 3 devices
- If you buy a license with 3 seats for you and your team, every team member can activate Sizzy on 3 devices at the same time

Since we launched in 2019, many things changed and improved in Sizzy.
It began as a very basic tool where you could test if your responsive design works fine, and now it's an irreplaceable browser not only for developers,
but designers and QA teams as well. We have been continuously working and investing in our app.

Along the way, we launched more than [100 new features](/features): like Sizzy Projects, Reference Browser, Snippets, Tasks, Notes, Presets, API Inspector, Session Manager, etc. We have also improved the performance significantly. Sizzy runs way faster now, and it is more intuitive to use, thanks to the new design.

Today we are officially announcing our *first* price increase, as a reflection of the significant value that Sizzy brings.
This  increase will affect only our **new** customers. If you're an existing customer who purchased before August 18th, you can keep the old pricing forever. Thank you for being with us since the beginning üôè

The price increase is not the only change that we have made. Along with the price increase, we also simplified the structure of our subscription plans and seats.
Up until now, every seat owner could activate the Sizzy license only on one device. That pricing seemed a bit unfair, so we changed it.

We are happy to tell you, that now each seat owner can activate their license on three devices at the same time, regardless of the plan they're on.

Among other things that we have on our agenda, we started planning how to revamp and simplify the entire Sizzy workflow (Workspace, Sessions, Presets, Reference Browser)
Yes, this means multiple tabs are coming soon :)

We keep innovating, but at the same time we acknowledge the requests of our customers.

We thank you for all of your support!
