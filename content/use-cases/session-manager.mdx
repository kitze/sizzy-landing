description: Instead of logging in and out or switching between incognito windows, in Sizzy you can easily browse and test different user accounts at once

## Problem
- Developer works on an web app or website with multiple user roles (i.e Admin, Creator, Developer 1, Guest)
- Developer wants to
  - Change their code and make sure that a page (i.e the home page) will work fine for different user roles
  - Perform an action from the Creator account (i.e create an article), perform an action from the User 1 account (i.e leave a comment), and see how the Admin and Guest will look

## In other browsers
- It takes way more time to do this
- Solution 1: Constantly log in and out to switch between developers (tedious)
- Solution 2: Open an incognito window, put the windows side by side, open different URLs
  - Downsides
    - This limits the developer to 2 user sessions: regular and incognito (most web apps have more than 2 roles to test)
    - Next time they close the incognito window their session and credentials will be lost, so they have to log in again
- Solution 3: Open a guest or another browser profile
  - Downsides
    - If developer is working on multiple projects their list of profiles is going to be huge and messy
    - A profile is always opened in a separate window, so a mess of window occurs
    - Opening multiple profiles and navigating to a URL every time you want to test different roles takes a lot of time

## In Sizzy
- With the Session Manager you can create as many sessions as you want, and log in with different user (or keep one session with a logged out user)
- Solution 1: Easily switch the global session for all devices (to switch between Admin, Creator, User 1, or any other role)
- Solution 2: Switch and have a different session for each device (this is even more powerful because you can see multiple users side by side)
- This can be even more advanced by combining the Session Manager with Testing multiple URLs
- Bonus: The first time you create a device layout with sessions that you want to test, you can easily save it as a Preset.
  - Next time you want to test these roles, you can quickly click on the Preset
