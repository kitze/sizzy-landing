Hey boss,

There’s a developer tool that looks great.

It is a specialized browser that saves a bunch of time and has many tools that can significantly improve our dev workflow.

It's just $12 per month (we can save more with a team discount) and the reviews are excellent.

Many popular companies and developers are already using it and loving it. Here’s the link: https://sizzy.co

Is it OK to expense this?

P.S. should we also offer it to the team? (they have a team discount)
