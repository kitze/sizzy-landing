description: Sizzy desperately needs a new landing page and we're looking for a copywriter that will tell the proper story about it.
---

Sizzy is a specialised browser for frontend developers. Actually, at this point, calling it only a browser is a bit insulting! It's the ultimate toolkit that any frontend developer should use if they want to work faster and save a lot of time.

Even after reading the first 2 sentences of this job post you can understand that we’re terrible at describing what Sizzy is and what it does :)

Some of our users really get how powerful Sizzy is, but we have a hard time selling this story to other users and potential customers. Most users just use the basic features a few times per day, even though we made Sizzy with the idea that a developer should use it throughout their entire work day.

Why are users not getting it? Let's see.

We scraped together the initial landing page 3 years ago. Since then, we redesigned it only once. Sizzy is made by two developers, and none of us is a copywriter or a designer. Even though the end result is not bad, the landing page is completely underselling what Sizzy is, who is it for, and what it does. The copy is pretty basic and the design is meh.
The biggest issue that we have with hiring a copywriter for this job is that unless you’re highly technical, or a developer, it’s going to be hard to understand the benefits of Sizzy. To help with this issue, we started publishing some of the use cases of Sizzy here → [Sizzy Use Cases](/use-cases)

We want to make a new landing page from scratch, and before hiring a designer, we want to have the perfect content and layout for the landing page.

We're searching for a copywriter with the following requirements:
- Is specialized in landing pages
- Is technical and has written content for apps and SaaS before
- Can write the content of the page but also make a skeleton of the website (how should the layout look like, how many different pages, what will their individual content be, etc.)
- Can understand what Sizzy is and what are the main features and benefits
- Will do a deep dive into customers (who they are, beliefs, barriers, drivers, etc)
